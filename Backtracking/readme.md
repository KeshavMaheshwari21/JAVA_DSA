# Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end. It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem, such as searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles like Sudoku. When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different path until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

## How Backtracking Algorithm Works

1. **Choose an Initial Solution**: Start with an initial choice or decision.
2. **Explore All Possible Extensions**: Try to extend the current solution by making subsequent choices.
3. **Check Solution Validity**:
   - If an extension leads to a valid solution, return that solution.
   - If an extension does not lead to a valid solution, backtrack to the previous decision point.
4. **Backtrack and Explore**: Undo the last choice and try a different extension from the previous point.
5. **Repeat**: Continue steps 2-4 until all possible solutions have been explored.

## Applications

Backtracking is particularly useful for solving problems where the solution space is large and complex. It can be applied to:

- **Maze Solving**: Finding a path from the start to the end.
- **Puzzle Solving**: Examples include Sudoku and the N-Queens problem.
- **Combinatorial Problems**: Generating permutations and combinations.

## Examples

Here are some common problems solved using backtracking:

- **N-Queens Problem**: Placing N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Subset Sum Problem**: Finding subsets of numbers that add up to a given target sum.
