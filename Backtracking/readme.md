Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.
It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem, like searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles like Sudoku. When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different path until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

How a backtracking algorithm works:
1. Choose an initial solution.
2. Explore all possible extensions of the current solution.
3. If an extension leads to a solution, return that solution.
4. If an extension does not lead to a solution, backtrack to the previous solution and try a different extension.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible solutions have been explored
